# Recognition of Affective Prosody

* Isolating processes within the brain that are specific to human behavior is a key goal for social neuroscience. The current research was an attempt to test whether recent findings of enhanced negative ERPs in response to unexpected human gaze are unique to eye gaze stimuli by comparing the effects of gaze cues with the effects of an arrow cue. An enhanced negative ERP (N300) will be recorded in response to negative stimulations. The findings will interpreted as reflecting a domain general mechanism for detecting unexpected events specially in terms of syntax and semantics.
* We will first test if we can detect this response and iteratively design experiments to make this detection better.
